# ADLS2-MachineLearning

This is the GitHub Page for the ADLS 2 Project on Machine Learning. 
Two students, Pia and Luigi will work on this seperately. They are expected to take different approaches and find alternative approaches either for the same question or they may take a totally different approach. As long as they stick the input data short tandem repeats, their work will be highly appreciated.

## Project Summary:
Applying Machine Learning on repetitive DNA sequences

Beschreibung:
Learning based on DNA mutations to predict gene expression changes is an emerging approach that has a wide range of potential applications. These approaches are mostly performed on one nucleotide mutations and prove to be highly accurate. Yet, human DNA is more enriched with repeat copy number mutations of short repetitive sequences. Since these confer the most of variation across healthy human populations as well as in certain diseases such as cancer, we are interested in building learning algorithms based on repetitive sequences. In this project, we will focus specifically in predicting genic locations based on repetitive sequence length. This task is part of a large SNSF funded project as part of a research consortium.

Auftrag: First steps will involve writing an algorithm to learn and predict genic locations (coding, introns, promoters etc) based on DNA repeat sequence length. The list of the sequences are ready, and there is an example to guide you written in Google Colab. If preferred, we can set up a high performance cluster account and finalize the algorithm there. Once this is accomplished, you may take the challenge to focus on mutations or even connect the mutations to phenotype.

Resultate: A machine learning algorithm on DNA repeat sequences
Voraussetzungen: Basic knowledge in programming (Python) and machine learning
Kompetenzgewinn: Improving coding skills in python Experience working in high computing cluster  Further knowledge on machine learning algorithms and apply that on DNA sequences Learn about DNA mutations

## Notebook:
Below is the notebook our master student started working on. You are free to use this as a reference for you but no need to constrain yourself by this approach. I have helpful resources in this notebook. You will need to have a look at the those and the notebook before the next meeting and we will discuss it together. Only after our second meeting, I will ask you to start thinking of your initial approach, at which point we will start meeting individually. With that said, I am happy to make any changes that will help you in this process.
